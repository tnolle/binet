# BINet: Multi-perspective Business Process Anomaly Classification
This is the complementary repository for BINet, a neural network architecture for multi-perspective anomaly detection 
and classification in business process event logs.
BINet was originally proposed in [3] and then extended in [4].
The repository also contains implementations of all methods mentioned in [3, 4].
Specifically, it also contains the implementations for the DAE method from [1, 2].

All results can be reproduced using the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

## Additional Material
To complement the findings in [3] this repository contains Jupyter notebooks.
The notebooks are named according to the sections in the paper.
Numbers beginning with `A` contain additional material which is not included in the papers.
The code to reproduce the figures in the paper can be found inside the notebooks.
All necessary files to reproduce the results are also included in the repository.

## Setup
The easiest way to setup an environment is to use Miniconda.

### Using Miniconda
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (make sure to use a Python 3 version)
2. After setting up miniconda you can make use of the `conda` command in your command line (Powershell, CMD, Bash)
3. We suggest that you set up a dedicated environment for this project by running `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    * This will setup a virtual conda environment with all necessary dependencies.
    * If your device does have a GPU replace `tensorflow` with `tensorflow-gpu` in the `environement.yml`
4. Depending on your operating system you can activate the virtual environment with `conda activate binet` 
on Linux and macOS, and `activate ad` on Windows (`cmd` only).
5. If you want to make use of a GPU, you must install the CUDA Toolkit. To install the CUDA Toolkit on your computer refer to the [TensorFlow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows).
6. If you want to quickly install the `april` package, run `pip install -e .` inside the root directory.
7. Now you can start the notebook server by `jupyter notebook notebooks`.

Note: To use the graph plotting methods, you will have to install Graphviz.
